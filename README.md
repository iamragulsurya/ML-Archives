### NLP Projects

The `nlp/` directory contains projects related to Natural Language Processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, text generation, language modeling, and more. These projects explore various deep learning architectures and techniques for understanding, processing, and generating human-readable text.

### CV Projects

The `cv/` directory houses projects focused on Computer Vision tasks like image classification, object detection, style transfer, and others. These projects leverage deep learning models to analyze, understand, and manipulate visual data, including images and videos.

### Multimodals Projects

The `multimodal/` directory includes projects that combine multiple modalities, such as vision and language. These projects aim to tackle complex tasks that require understanding and reasoning across different data types, like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning, and Video Understanding.
